				About Me
				<hr>
				<p>
					Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!

					Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord.
